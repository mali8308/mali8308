# 👋 Hello, I'm Ali!

🌟 **Fulbright Scholar** | **Computational Aging Researcher** | **Graduate Student @ NYU** 

I'm deeply invested in unraveling the thread - or rather breaking the shackles - of aging through computational biology. While most people's idea of a fun time is enjoying a light-hearted sitcom on Netflix, mine is finding a new dataset, going on RStudio, and running my scripts to see if I unconver some new mysteries of aging! 

My end-goal is to _end_ "end" goals; life does not have to be limited by biology - or at least it certainly should not be. 

### 🚀 What I'm working on
- **Developing biological aging clock**: predicting age correctly is the first step to understanding aging. 
- **Analyzing large-scale multi-omics datasets to find genetic targets**: the answers are out there somewhere; we just need to look hard enough (or in the right places). 
  
### 🔬 Research interests
- **Epigenetic aging** 
- **Computational genomics of aging** 
- **Machine learning for genomics** 

### 🏆 Achievements
- **Fulbright Scholarship**
- **NYU GSAS Full Tuition Scholarship**
- **NYU Biology Master’s Research Grant**
- **NUST Best Researcher Award (Rector's Gold Medal)**

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not analyzing genomes, you might find me jumping out of a plane from 10,000 feet up in the air 🛩️
